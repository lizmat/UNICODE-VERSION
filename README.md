NAME
====

UNICODE-VERSION - Provide $?UNICODE-VERSION for older Raku versions

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use UNICODE::VERSION;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

UNICODE-VERSION checks the unicode database at compile time for certain marker codepoints that got added at certain unicode versions and exports a `%?UNICODE-VERSION` `Version` constant that indicates the version of Unicode that is currently being supported, as determined by those codepoints.

Algorithm suggested by Stephen Schulze
